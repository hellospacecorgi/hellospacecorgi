# hello-world!

Finally hopping on to Git Hub to leave traces after being a CS student for 3 years.
This serves as a little self introduction about me to the internet.

[update] I'm currently moving my uni projects over to Github!
- <a href="https://github.com/hellospacecorgi/spacetraders_java">SpaceTraders API GUI Java App</a>

Interested projects / learning paths:
- Data analysis and visualisation project with R (Had fun with R in MATH1005 Stat Thinking with Data)
- Go through the mess of a code in that Processing game project that I have been procrastinating since 2017
- Following up on that, p5.js
- Simple app (anything that will load on my phone I will be more than happy to claim as success kick off)
- Simple game (Looking at free game engines like Corona (NOT the virus), Defold)

Some things that I am currently following:
- Audacity open source development (Just a lurker on their mailing list but hey keen to learn!)
- hackerrank 30 days of code (Switching from Java, Python and C depending on challenge)
- hackthebox (sadly uni's society workshop has been cancelled due to the corona virus situation :( )

Other useful things that might help with creating an online presence:
- Github pages? for a personal website as CV/Resume

Happy handwashing, social distancing and MOAH LEARNING.
